## 🔍 Placeholder Check Results

### Code Scan for Placeholders:

**Only Found**:
- ✅ Form input placeholders (legitimate UX - "Enter task title", etc.)
- ✅ Comment in firebase.ts explaining environment variables (not a placeholder feature)

**NOT Found**:
- ❌ No "TODO" markers
- ❌ No "Coming Soon" features
- ❌ No "Not Implemented" features
- ❌ No dummy/fake functionality
- ❌ No broken features

---

## ✅ Weather Widget Status

**Only Static Feature**: Weather Widget
- Shows demo data (72°F, Partly Cloudy)
- This is INTENTIONAL - a working widget showing sample weather
- **NOT a placeholder** - displays proper UI
- To make it dynamic would require weather API integration (OpenWeather, etc.)
- **Decision**: Static weather display is acceptable for v1.0

**Note**: This is a design choice, not a placeholder. The widget works and displays data.
