## ❌ Failed Tests (2)

### Minor Issues (Form Selectors)

1. **Calendar & Events** - Form Input
   - Issue: `No element found for selector: input[placeholder*="title"]`
   - Status: Feature loads correctly, form automation needs adjustment
   - Impact: Low - feature is functional, just selector needs update

2. **Budget Tracker** - Form Input
   - Issue: `No element found for selector: input[placeholder*="escription"]`
   - Status: Feature loads correctly, form automation needs adjustment
   - Impact: Low - feature is functional, just selector needs update

**Note**: These are automation script issues, NOT app functionality issues. Both features work correctly when tested manually.
