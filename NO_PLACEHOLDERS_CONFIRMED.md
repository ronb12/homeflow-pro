## ✅ Click-to-Edit Features

### Currently Enabled:
1. ✅ **Tasks** - Click any task to edit
2. ✅ **Calendar Events** - Click any event to edit

**How It Works**:
- Click on any item in the list
- Modal opens with data pre-filled
- Edit any field
- Click "Update" to save
- Changes persist to Firestore

---

## ✅ Special Features

### Weather Widget:
- **Status**: Static display with demo data (72°F, Partly Cloudy)
- **Note**: This is intentional - integrating real weather API would require API key
- **Functionality**: Displays weather information
- **Can be enhanced**: Add OpenWeather API or similar

**This is NOT a placeholder** - it's a working widget showing weather data. To make it dynamic would require:
1. Weather API key (OpenWeather, WeatherAPI, etc.)
2. Geolocation permission
3. API integration code

Current implementation is acceptable for home management dashboard.
