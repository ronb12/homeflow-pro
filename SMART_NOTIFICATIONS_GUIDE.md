```

#### 📋 **Task Reminders**

**Example:**
```
📋 Task Due Today
"Buy groceries" is due today
Priority: High
```

#### 🔐 **Password Expiration Alerts**
- **7 Days Before Expiration:** Medium priority
- **1 Day Before:** High priority
- **Expired:** High priority warning

**Example:**
```
🔐 Password Expiring Soon
Password for "Gmail" expires in 3 days
Priority: Medium
```

#### 📦 **Package Delivery Notifications**
- **Status Changed to "Delivered":** Automatic notification

**Example:**
```
📦 Package Delivered
"Amazon Package - New Headphones" has been delivered!
